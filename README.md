## Overview

Samsung's Galaxy S26 Ultra ships a feature called **Super Steady with Horizon Lock** that keeps your footage perfectly level no matter how much you tilt or shake the phone. It's one of the most impressive stabilisation tricks in mobile cameras right now - and it was exclusive to Android.

**Stable Action brings that exact same experience to iOS.** Point it at anything, tilt your wrist, run, jump, ride - the horizon stays locked flat, just like on the S26 Ultra. Built entirely in native Swift, runs 100% on-device, no subscriptions, no cloud.

## Inspired by Samsung Super Steady Horizon Lock

The Galaxy S26 Ultra's Horizon Lock works by cropping into the sensor and counter-rotating that crop window against the phone's tilt in real time. The result is a video where the horizon never moves, even when the phone is spinning in your hand.

Stable Action replicates this using the exact same principle - gyroscope-driven counter-rotation, a floating crop window inside a larger sensor buffer, and hardware ISP stabilisation layered on top. It also adds **translation correction** (up/down/left/right drift compensation) that Samsung's version doesn't publicly advertise.

## Features

| | Feature | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 🎯 | **Horizon Lock** | Gyroscope-driven crop counter-rotation at 120 Hz |
| 🔄 | **Full 360° Roll** | Continuous angle unwrapping — no flip at ±180° |
| 📐 | **Gimbal-feel Translation** | Velocity-damped X/Y stabilisation with position decay |
| 🔧 | **Hardware Stabilisation** | ISP `.cinematicExtendedEnhanced` in Action Mode |
| 👁 | **Preview = Recording** | Same pipeline for both — no surprises |
| 📷 | **Normal Mode** | Full-frame 1× wide camera, direct recording |
| 🎬 | **Action Mode** | Full Horizon Lock + translation + ultra-wide lens |
| 🗂 | **Gallery** | In-app browser for all recordings with full-screen playback |
| 🎯 | **Tap to Focus** | Lock focus and exposure to any point on screen |
| 💾 | **Auto Save** | Saves to Photos library automatically on stop |

## How it works

### The horizon rectangle

In Action Mode you're not seeing the full sensor frame. You're looking through a cropped **3:4 portrait window** floating in the middle of the sensor output. That window is intentionally smaller than the full frame - the surrounding space is the buffer the stabilisation uses to rotate and shift without ever hitting the edge.

Picture a picture frame floating inside a larger canvas. When the canvas tilts, the frame stays upright.

### Two corrections, every frame

**Roll correction** - the phone tilts, the crop window rotates the opposite direction by the exact same amount. They cancel out. The horizon stays flat. Roll tracking is **fully continuous** — angle is unwrapped across the ±180° boundary so spinning the phone a full 360° never causes a flip or jump.

**Translation correction** - the phone jerks sideways or up/down, the crop window slides the opposite way to compensate. The accelerometer detects the movement, integrates it into a velocity with exponential decay, and shifts the window against it. When movement stops, the window drifts back to centre with a `positionDecay` of 0.992 — giving it the hold-and-release feel of a real gimbal.

### Hardware on top

Stable Action also engages the iPhone's built-in ISP stabilisation on every frame. Hardware cleans up micro-jitter - hand tremor, footstep impact, engine vibration. Software handles the macro roll. The two layers stack.

### Normal vs Action Mode

| | Normal Mode | Action Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Lens** | 1× Wide | Ultra-wide (crop buffer) |
| **Preview** | Full sensor frame | Stabilised 3:4 crop |
| **Roll correction** | ✗ | ✓ (360° continuous) |
| **Translation correction** | ✗ | ✓ (gimbal-feel) |
| **Hardware ISP** | `.auto` | `.cinematicExtendedEnhanced` |
| **Recorded area** | Full frame | Stabilised crop only |

## Usage

```
1. Open the app                    → camera starts in Normal mode (1× wide)
2. Toggle Action Mode              → Horizon Lock pipeline activates (ultra-wide)
3. Tilt the phone                  → horizon stays locked flat, full 360°
4. Tap anywhere                    → locks focus + exposure to that spot
5. Press the red button            → starts recording (REC pulses at top)
6. Press again                     → stops, saves to Photos automatically
7. Tap the thumbnail (bottom-left) → plays back the last clip in-app
8. Tap the gallery icon (bottom-right) → browse all past recordings
```

## Installation

> **No App Store required.** Download the `.ipa` directly from the [Releases page](https://github.com/scienceLabwork/Stable-Action/releases) and sideload it onto your iPhone using one of the methods below.

### Method 1 — AltStore (recommended, free)

1. Install **[AltStore](https://altstore.io)** on your Mac or PC and follow its one-time setup guide to install the AltStore companion app on your iPhone.
2. Download **`StableAction_1.0.ipa`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/scienceLabwork/Stable-Action/releases/latest).
3. Open the `.ipa` file on your iPhone (tap *Share → AltStore → Install App*), **or** drag the `.ipa` onto the AltStore window on your computer.
4. AltStore will sign and install the app. Once installed, open **Stable Action** from your home screen.

> AltStore re-signs the app automatically every 7 days as long as your iPhone is on the same Wi-Fi network as the AltStore desktop app.

### Method 2 — Sideloadly (free, Windows & Mac)

1. Download and install **[Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io)** on your computer.
2. Download **`StableAction_1.0.ipa`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/scienceLabwork/Stable-Action/releases/latest).
3. Connect your iPhone to your computer with a USB cable and trust the computer when prompted.
4. Open Sideloadly, drag the `.ipa` into the window, enter your Apple ID, and click **Start**.
5. On your iPhone go to **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management**, tap your Apple ID, and tap **Trust**.
6. Open **Stable Action** from your home screen.

> Like AltStore, Sideloadly apps expire after 7 days with a free Apple ID and must be re-signed. A paid Apple Developer account ($99/year) extends this to 1 year.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Untrusted Developer" alert | Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → Trust your Apple ID |
| App crashes on launch | Make sure you are on **iOS 16 or later** |
| Install fails in Sideloadly | Try a different USB cable or port, or restart Sideloadly |
| AltStore can't find the app | Ensure iPhone and Mac/PC are on the same Wi-Fi network |

## Requirements

- iPhone with iOS 17 or later
- iOS 18 or later for best Action Mode stabilisation
- Physical device required — camera and gyroscope unavailable in Simulator

---

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| **Camera** | To capture video |
| **Microphone** | To record audio alongside video |
| **Photos (add only)** | To save finished clips to your library |
